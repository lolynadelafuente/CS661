# CS661 Breast Cancer Detection

## Dataset: Kaggle
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/code/faresmohammad/breast-cancer-detection

## Purpose:
The purpose of our project is to predict with accuracy if a tumor cell is malignant or
benign by utilizing machine learning algorithms with various predictive models for breast
cancer detection. By employing different classification algorithms, we aim to explore and
compare their performance in accurately identifying whether a tumor is malignant or
benign based on the provided attributes.

#### -Independent Variable (X) = All the columns except for the ‘Diagnosis’ variable
#### -Dependent Variable(y) = ‘Diagnosis’ (Predicting if a patient has cancer (1=M) or not (0=B))

The analysis involved data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, outlier detection, model
building, evaluation, and comparison. Each step contributes to understanding the
dataset and evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms in
breast cancer detection.

### 1. Exploratory Analysis 
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution
and relationships between different features within the dataset. This will involve visualizations
and statistical summaries to gain insights into the data.

### 2. Feature Importance
Evaluate the importance of features in determining the nature of the
tumor (malignant or benign) using various algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests,
and others to identify which attributes have the most significant impact on the classification.

### 3. Model Development
Implement different classification algorithms including Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision
Trees, and Random Forests. Compare and evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve.

### 4. Model Comparison
Analyze and compare the performance metrics of each model to identify
the most effective algorithm for breast cancer detection based on the dataset.

### 5. Optimization and Validation
Optimize the selected models by tuning hyperparameters and
conduct cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability of the chosen algorithm(s) for
accurate prediction
